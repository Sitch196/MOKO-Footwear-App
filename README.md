Working on this project was Challenging . I used React with RectRouter and Vite for bundling this application.
Real Challenge for me was adding products to cart ,but i figured it out after i started looking into Context api which really made 
my life easierIn general i've become more comfortable using react hooks . Styling is Done with Styled Components . TypeScript is another new 
technology i've tried and applied to this project . I feel very proud that my hard work amounted to this , obviously i'will keep improving and make
my appllications more complex in the future
